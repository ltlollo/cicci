Computational Boolean Algebra

kmaps impractical for large boolean functions, conputational approach is needed

Shannon expantion
given a boolean function F(x0..xn) -> Bool
Shannon cofactor for xi is the pair
	F(x0, .. xi = 0, xn), negative cofactor
	F(x0, .. xi = 1, xn), positive cofactor
sometimes abbriviated as F(xi=0), F(xi=1) or F_x', F_x
Note negate is experessed as : ~a = a' = !a

Shannon expansion theorem
F(x0..xn) = xi * F(xi=1) + ~xi * F(xi=0)

this can be repeated for arch variable, eg
f(x, y) =
f(x, y) = x f(x=1) + ~x f(x=0) =
f(x, y) = x (y f(x=1, y=1) + ~y f(x=1, y=0)) + ~x (y f(x=0, y=1) + ~y f(x=0, y=0)) =
f(x, y) = x y f(x=1, y=1) + x ~y f(x=1, y=0) + ~x y f(x=0, y=1) + ~x ~y f(x=0, y=0)


given two functions F(x..), G(x..) functions of n variables
proprieties:
(F')_x = (F_x)'
(F G)_x = F_x G_x
(F + G)_x = F_x + G_x
(F ^ G)_x = F_x ^ G_x

Boolean derivatives
df / dx = f_x ^ f_x'	where ^ is xor, a ^ b = ab' + a'b
	or df/fx = f(x=1) ^ f(x=0)

prop.
comm: d(df / dx) / dy = d(df / dy) / dx
distr xor: d(f ^ g) / dx = df/dx ^ dg/dx
	NOTE: d does NOT distribute with and and or (*, +)

df/dx = 0 if f is constant

Examples
f = x'						not
df/dx = 0 ^ 1 = 1

f = x * y					and
df/dx = y ^ 0 = y

f = x + y					or
df/dx = 1 ^ y = y'

f = x ^ y					xor
df/dx = y' ^ y = 1

NOTE if you manage to calc df/dx = 1, by setting the correct value of y
that value of y is the value so that every time x changes, f(x, y) changes
eg of x+y df/dx = 1 for y=0, so f(x,y=0) = x+0 changes every time x changes

refrased:
the boolean difference explains how an input change causes an output change for
a boolean function f

also df/dx does NOT depend on x
------

what if instead of ^ -> * or + in the f(x=1) _?_ f(x=0) formula?

AND cofactors: F_x * F_x'
universal quantification (forall xi F) [x0..xi-1 xi+1..xn]
g = (forall x F) is a new boolean function

OR cofactors: F_x + F_x'
existential quantification (exists xi F) [x0..xi-1 xi+1..xn]
g = (exists x F) is a new boolean function


given f(.. x ...)
	what happens when g = (forall x f) = 1?
	then the input makes f 1 for all values of x (indipendent of x)

	what happens when g = (exists x f) = 1?
	then for this input it exists a value of x st f is 1

Additional props
	f(x, y, ...)
	(forall x y F) = F_xy * F_x'y * F_xy' * F_x'y'		and of all cofactors
	(exists x y F) = F_xy + F_x'y + F_xy' + F_x'y'		or of all cofactors

Network Repair

f(a, b) = ab + b'
broken network g = ab ? b'

replace suspect broken gate ? with a mux
mux(s1, s2, d0..d3) s1, s2 are the original inputs
find values of d0..d3 so that mux(ab, b', d0..3) = f

g(a, b, d0, d1, d2, d3) is the function with ? replaced with mux
f(a, b) is the working function

z = g xnor f = z(a, b, d0..d3)
note: xnor a, b = 1 iff a == b


(forall a b z) [d0..d3] == 1?
are the values of d's that make z = 1 for all values of a and b



equation of the multiplexer :
mux(s0, s1, d0..d3) = d0 s1' s0' + d1 s1' s0 + d2 s1 s0' + d3 s1 s0

g = mux(b', ab) =
g = d0 (ab)' b'' + d1 (ab)' b' + d2 (ab) b'' + d3 (ab) b'
g = d0 (ab)' b + d1 (ab)' b' + d2 (ab) b + d3 ab b'
g = d0 (ab)' b + d1 (ab)' b' + d2 ab
g = d0 (ab)' b + d1 (ab)' b' + d2 ab
g = d0 a'b + d1 b' + d2 ab


z = g xnor f = f g + f'g'

the solution is
(foreach a b z) = Z_ab * Z_a'b * Z_ab' * Z_a'b'

use the fact that the cofactor of xnor is xnor of cofactors

z = (d0 a'b + d1 b' + d2 ab) + (ab + b')

z_a'b'	= d1 xnor 1 = d1
z_a'b	= d0 xnor 0 = d0'
z_ab'	= d1 xnor 1 = d1
z_ab	= d2 xnor 1 = d2


note
	z_a'b' = x1 a'b' + x2 a'b + x3 ab' + x4 ab = x1 the factor that matches
	the cofactor values

(forall a b z) = d1 * d0' * d1 * d2 = d0' d1 d2

solution is value of d0..d3 st forall is a 1
	d0 = 0, d1 = 1, d2 = 1, d3 = X
		where X = does not matter

the solution can be (d0..3) = 0111 = OR which is the original solution (ab+b')
but also 0110 = XOR which also repair the circuit
	because ab + b' = ab ^ b'

what was done in f(p...) = 1 is called SAT :
	find the vaues, if any, of p... st f = 1 (there can be 0-ways to satisfy)

Tautology


f == 1

strategy :
split f over x

prove that
f(x=0) == 1
prove that
f(x=1) == 1

because f == 1 <=> f(x=1) == 1 * f(x=0) == 1
						AND ---^

to represent a boolean formula write as sum of products
f(a, b, c) = a' + bc + ab
has N terms (sum 1:n) (N=3)
formula of M variables (M=3)

list of cubes in hypercube (see hypercube notation)

the representation is a vector of N elements
each element is a vector of M elements_
each element_ is
	01 if the corrisponding variable appears in the formula as x
	10 if the corrisponding variable appears in the formula as x'
	11 if the corrisponding variable does not appear in the formula

eg
f(a, b, c) = a' = [[10, 11, 11]]
g(a, b, c) = bc = [[11, 01, 01]]

f * g = the and of the terms [[10, 01, 01]] = a'bc

a * a' = [[00, 11, 11]] => if the value is 00 the formula goes away


splitting in the two cofactor over x of f(...x...) is
importatnt to verify if f is a tautology, what is the algo to calculate the
cofactors then?


f_x = f(x=1)
[...10...] -> drop from the list 
[...01...] -> replace with [...11...]
[...11...] -> leave it alone

f_x' = f(x=0)
[...10...] -> replace with [...11...]
[...01...] -> drop from the list 
[...11...] -> leave it alone


eg. f = abd + bc' = [[01 01 11 01], [11 01 10 11]]

f_a = [[11 01 11 01], [11 01 10 11]]
f_c = [[01 01 11 01], []] = [[01 01 11 01]]

-----

Unate function
	a boolean funtion when variables appear in only one polarity.
	if the variable name is x then only x can appear in the formula, so no x'
								or only x' can appear in the formula, so no x
		eg: ab + ac'd+c'de' (appears: a, b, c', d, e')

	unate over a variable x if the propriety applyes only to the x variable
		eg: ab+b' is unate over a

	positive unate in var x if f(x=0) <= f(x=1)
	negative unate in var x if f(x=0) >= f(x=1)

	if f is not unate, is called binate



given the cube list form
	f = [[01 11 11] [11 10 01] [01 11 01]] is unate if
	each variable it mantains the same value OR don't care

	f = [[01 11 11]
		 [11 10 01]
		 [01 11 01]]
	  = [[01 -- --]
		 [-- 10 01]
		 [01 -- 01]] is unate



unate propriety is importatn because
th: a unate cube list is a tautology iff it contains all don't care cubes
	[11 11 ... 11]
because [11 11 11 11 11.....] is the formula for 1, doesn't care about input,
but returns a 1

Rule 1:
	if [11 ... 11] is in a cube list L -> L is a tautology
Rule 2
	if a cube list L is unate, but does not contain [11 ... 11], L != 1
	not a tautology


in the algo to verify if a formula is a tautology, when we split we choose
as heuristic, the most 'binate' variable

variable in a N list
	dc	= #11
	t	= #01
	f	= #10
		where t+n+dc = N

	unate if t = 0 or f = 0
	most binate is the one that max (t+n)
	in case there are multiple, the min abs(t-n)


the algorithm is called URP (Unate Recursive Paradigm)

Logic Synthesis - 2 level logic (AND - OR)

to get a optimal K-map algo : reduce-expand-irredundant loop

Reduce : shrink the cubes that are overlapping
Expand : given a non optimal K-map grow each cube to be maximal
Iddedundant : Kill the cubes that are redundant

Prime (all cubes are maximal), irredundant (cubes cannot be removed) =>
	reduce ->
not prime
	-> expand =>
prime, not irredundant
	-> irredundant =>
prime, irredundant


in cube notation : expand == remove one or more variable

algebraically expand becomes a covering problem:
	goven a boolean matrix M(n x m)
	a cover for M : a set of rows that "cover" (has 1) all the columns
	when ORred together


eg
	0 1 0 1		|	cover all the matrix [0] ^ [1] = 1 1 1 1
	1 0 1 0		|
	0 0 1 0
	0 1 1 1


	heuristic algo: find the smallest cover for a matrix


Expand :
	-choose a term to expand
	-find the OFF set (the same for the "cover" but with 0
		it is done using the URP complement of the function F to get F'
	-create a table for the terms of F' in the cols
		and the elements of the term you want to expand in the rows


		eg F = w'y'z' + xz +x'yz' + w'xyz'
		F' = x'z + wxz' + wy'z'

		choose to expand " w'xyz' " because it has size 1 in the K-map
		table
		put 0 in same polarity / dont' care
		put 1 in opposite polarity
			
				x'z | wxz' | wy'z'
				-----------------
			w'|       1      1				//space is 0
			x | 1
			y |	             1
			z'|	1

		1 == cube NOT allowed to expand in this places

	-find a cover in this table
		eg. w'x, or w'z

	-keep the variable selected
		w'xyz' -> EXPAND -> w'x
			OR
		w'xyz' -> EXPAND -> w'z

Algo pro/cons:
	best, not optimal
	minimal, not minimum, prime irredundant

To factor the bool expresions, use the Algebraic Model,
so threat variables as numbers, * -> mul, + -> addition
LOOSE this proprieties:
	a+a' = 1		a*a' =0
	a * a = a		a+a=a
	a+1=1			a+(b*c) = (a+b) * (a+c)


USE JUST THIS props
	a*b = b*a
	a+b = b+a
	a*(b*c) = (a*b)*c
	a+(b+c) = (a+b)+c
	a*(b+c) = a*b + a*c
	a*1 = a
	a*0 = 0
	a+0 = a

as i lost the "modulo, inverse" proprieties, negate values becomes new
variables
	eg : F = ab+a'x+b'y
	becomes :
		let R = a'
		let S = b'
		F = ab+Rx+Sy
	

##

How to find good divisors?
using kernel / cokernels

Divisors are found in kernels of F, K(F)

How to find k in K(F) ? divide F y one of it's co-kernels c



A kernel k of F boolean expression is
a cube-free quotion obtained by dividing F by a single cube c
c is a co-kernel of F

			quotient F
		  -----------------
divisor D|	expression F
			   ____________
				remainder R

F = DQ + R
~~~

			kernel k if !!cube-free!!
c = 1 cube	expr F
				remainder R

F = ck + R


Cube-free : a+b, a+b+c, ab+acd+bd // non posso raccogliere
not cube free: a == a(1), ab+ac == a(b+c), abc+abn+a = a(bc+bn+1)



eg	F = abc+abd+bcd
cube d			F=dQ+R				is kernel of F
1				1(abc+abd+bcd)+0	No, has cube = "b" as factor
a				a(bc+bd)+bcd		No, has cube = "b" as factor
b				b(ac+ad+cd)			yes, "ac+ad+cd" is a kernel, with co-k "b"
ab				ab(c+d)+bcd			yes, "c+d" is a k with co-k "ab"


NOTE: Kernels are not unique
-----
Bryton McMullen Th:
 F, G have dovisor d <=> k1 in K(F), k1 in K(G), d = k1 intersect k2, d has 2 cubes

it means that to look for common factors of F, G must look in the intersection
of the two kernels


for k1 in K(F):
	for k2 in K(G):
		size (d = k1 `intersect` k2) >= 2
			factor F, G by d
			break;



eg
	F = cube1 * [k1 = x+y+stuff1] + R1
	G = cube2 * [k2 = x+y+stuff2] + R2

	F = cube1 * [x+y] + cube1 * stuff1 + r1
	G = cube2 * [x+y] + cube2 * stuff2 + r12

	
	new reduced:
	let d = x+y
	F = cube1 * d + cube1 * stuff1 + r1
	G = cube2 * d + cube2 * stuff2 + r2




-----
How to find elements of K(F)?
recursion:
suppose to have F = cube * k1 + r1
	k1 is a boolean function with kernel K(k1)

	k2 in K(k1) => k1 = cube2 * k2 + r2

	F = cube1 * (cube2 * k2 + r2) + r1

	then since cube1 * cube2 is still a cube

	F = (cube1*cube2) * k2 + cube1 * r2 + r1
		_____________   __   _______________
		a cube       a quotioent      a rest

		therfore k2 is also a kernel for F



so k is a K0 kernel if it contains no other kernel except itself
a level Kn kernel if it contains at least one level n-1 level kernel



					F
					/\
				  K1  K2
				 /	  /\
				K0	 k0 K1
					     \
						  K0


co-kernels come from intersecting cubes in sum of product form
	so intersecting N>1 cubes of F we can get POTENTIALLY a co-kernel




FindKenrnels( __!!CubeFree!!__ SOP expression F)
	K = {}
	for variable x in F
		if a, b = findCubesWithVar(x)		// there myght be less than 2
			S = findCubesWithVar(x)			// list of cubes
			co = intersect(S)				// cube with litterals in all S cubes
			k = k union FindKernels(F / co) // F/co remove all litterals in co = 01 -> 11
	K = K union F
	return K

NOTE: with the current algo must check before FindK if the expression is cube-free
	ALSO inside the recursion

NOTE: in the current algo kernels will be checked multiple times
	eg when variable x = a might find "b+c" kenel
		when variable x = d might find ... and FindK(...) can return also "b+c"


so given F, G
	when you want a single cube divisor, look for co-kernels
	when you want a multiple cube divisor, look for kernels




Extracting common divisors
----

F, G = d*Q1 + R1, d*Q2 + E2

d :=  common divisor
single cube divisor : look at co-kernels
multiple cube divisor : look at kernels

form SOP equations construct cube literal matrix :
	horz, M cols := # unique literals
	vert, N rows := # product terms
	M_i,j = 1 => literal_j present in priduct term_i | 0 => not present

eg. P = abc + bce, Q = a, R = bd

M	a b c d e
abc	1 1 1 0 0
bce	0 1 1 0 1
a	1 0 0 0 0
bd	0 1 0 1 0


find prime rectangle : biggest set of col x set of rows such that in the
intersection always a 1
	primerect = rows x cols, foreach i.rows, foreach j.cols M_i,j = 1

compute how many literals are saved :
	C := #cols
	W(r) := how many times product r appears in the network (in eg. in P, Q, R)
	L := (C-1) * (sum r. W(r)) - C		// literals saved

Multiple
----

find co-kernels, kernels // B-Mc theorem multiple cube factors are intersection
of the prduct terms in the kenrnels

MOTE: remember multiple co-k can have the same kernel, also ignore trivial
co-kernel = 1, kernel = full-expr

make co-kernel-cube matrix
hors : N cols := # unique cubes in all the kernels
	(eg {k} = {a+b+c, ab+bc} => a, b, c, ab, bc)
vert : M rows := # unique co-kernel x kernel pair
	(eg if co-k de has 2 kernels, it gets 2 colums)

M_i,j = 1 => cube_j present in (co-k, k)_i | 0 => not present


eg co, k = a, ce | b, a+c | de, a+ce | de, b+c

M	a b c ce
a	0 0 0 1
b	1 0 1 0
de	1 0 0 1
de	0 1 1 0

a good divisor is the prime retangle of matrix M (like in single cube case)

saved literals :
	col weights : foreach col c. W(c) := # literals in the column cube
	row weights : foreach row r. W(r) := 1 + # literals in co-k label
	element values : for each place in the M cover count the number of literals
	in the (co, k) (eg. for (de, a+b) = 3 + 3 = 6) 

	L = el.values - row w. - col w.

NOTE : after factorization remember to add new nodes, literals, add dont cares,
	update matrices, etc...


Finding prime rectangle in the matrix M
----

using greedy heuristic (heur: not global optimum, greedy : on row/col at the time)

Ping-pong heur.

1 pick best single row (1-row with max # liter saved)
2 look at other row with 1 in the same place, add them
3 look at other cols with 1 in the same place, add them
4 goto 2a until can proceed
5 quit

NOTE : really the cover is created partially enumerating (co-k, k),
	heuristically

NOTE : look up references
	(synthesis and opt of digital circuit)

Implicit don't cares

in multi level logic don't cares arise implicitly, must be searched for in
order to optimize

eg

f = Xb+bY+XY
X = ab

PIs (primary inpts) POs (primary outs) : PIs =  a, b, POs = f

a b X can occur?
0 0 0 1
0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1
0 1 1 0
1 0 0 1
1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0
1 1 1 1

analyze f and its vars

X b Y can occur?
0 0 0 1
0 0 1 1
0 1 0 1
0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 // because b=0,X=1 impossible
1 0 1 0 // because b=0,X=1 impossible
1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1

so, in Y/Xb Kmap Xb = 10 is impossible to occur -> don't care

Y/Xb	00 10 11 10
0		0  0  1  0
1		1  1  1  0

f = Xb + bY + XY
becomes

Y/Xb	00 10 11 10
0		0  0  1  d
1		0  1  1  d

f = X + bY  // !!! Saved a product term
which is more optimal (bigger covers in Kmaps, don't cares allow to cover more)

...


if Y = b+c
some more confs become impossible


Y/Xb	00 10 11 10
0		0  d  1  d
1		0  1  1  d

f = b !!! !!! just a wire


-----
Don't cares can also be analyzed form the point of vew of the outs

f = Xb+bY+XY

Z = fXd

X, Y as before

PIs a b c d
PO Z


f X d affect Z?
0 0 0 0					// if f changes form 0->1 does Z change? 
1 0 0 0 NO					

0 0 1 0
1 0 1 0 NO

0 1 0 0
1 1 0 0 NO

0 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 YES Z=f

given this info can simplify X b Y vars of f ?
yes
XbY = 0--					// - is don't care

Y/Xb	00 10 11 10
0		0  d  1  d
1		0  1  1  d

becomes

Y/Xb	00 10 11 10
0		d  d  d  d
1		d  d  1  d

f = 1

so in the end :
X = ab
f = 1	// gone
Y = b+c // useless
Z = Xd

----
Satisfiability dont cares
	belong to the wires INSIDE the network
Controllability dont cares
	patterns that happe at the inputs
Observability dont cares
	input patterns that make the outs insensitive to the out of the node
	patterns that mask the outs



dont cares are represented as a boolean fonction : f that makes a 1 if the
pattern is impossible
so can solve using BDDs, or other tecniqs

SDC (satisf. dont cates)
----
X = a+b
Y = ab
f = Xc + Yd + acd

PIs a, b, c, d
PO f

NOTE : SDC_fun satisfiability don't care for function fun

SDC_X (X, a, b) = 1 for impossible patters of Xab
SDC_Y (Y, a, b) = 1 for impossible patters of Yab


out of SDC_fun (fun, in...) is 1 if different than f(in...)		// diff than is XOR

eg.
	X = ab+c
	SDC_X = X ^ (ab+c)
		  = X'ab + X'c + Xa'c' + Xb'c'		// what makes this 1 is impossible
											// and can be used as dont care

	what make SDC_X == 1?
			Xabc
	X'ab	011-
	X'c		0--1
	Xa'c'	10-0
	Xb'c'	1-00


IMPORTANT : SDCs are not used to simplify, but used to calculate CDCs
	computability dont cares


CDCs
------

calc CDC_F

X1...Xn input to F = expr

.get all SDCs of X1...Xn
.OR alls SDCs
.universaly quantify away all variables that are NOT used inside this node F
.result is CDC_F == 1 is the impossible patters at input to node


CDC_F = (foreach. v, v not in F [ sum i, xi in F. SDC_Xi ])		// sum = OR


eg.

X=a+b
Y=ab
F=Xc+Yd+acd

CDF_f = (foreach. not input to f) (sum inputs_i SDC_i)
	=	(		b				) (sum i=X,Y,a,c,d SDC_i)

NOTE : how to calc SDC of PRIs like SDC_a, just an input wire?
	SDC_a = a ^ a = 0
	they can be just ignored


so, ignoring a, b, c, d

CDC_f = (foreach v. v=b) (sum i=X,Y . SDC_i)
		= (foreach b) (X ^ (a+b)) + (Y ^ ab))
		= (X ^ (a+b)) + (Y ^ ab))_(b=1) *  (X ^ (a+b)) + (Y ^ ab))_(b=0)
		= X'a + X'Y + Ya'


		so as CDC_f contains X'Y this means that X Y = 0 1 is impossible for f

----
External DCares

DC externally specified

eg.
input wires are a, b, c, d
but b=1, c=1, d=1

then create an external function that imposes this values, g then OR in the mix
SDC_g

SDC_g = bcd


so given the prev ex.

CDC_f = (foreach b) (..... + bcd)
		= X'a + X'Y + Ya' + a'cdX + acdY
		 \	old		   /	\	new		/

this means i get old impossible cubes + new impossible cubes

----
Observability dont care

output masked from affecting something

eg.
PIs : abc
PO  : Z

F = ab'+a'b				F : (a, b) :: Bool^2 -> Bool
Z = ab+Fc'+F'b'



ODC_F = patterns of (a,b) that make Z insensitive to F values
			// a, b are the inputs of F

This happens because Z also depends on other inputs
eg.
Z = F * 0 => Z insensiteive to F
Z = F + 1 => Z insensiteive to F

what makes F sensitive to X ? dF/dX == 1
what makes F INsensitive to X ? (dF/dX)' == 1
Z(F=0) == Z(F=1) => insensitive to F
Z_F == Z_F'		// using shannon co-factors

This happens when :
	(Z_F ^ Z_F')' == 1    <=>  (dZ/dF)' == 1

so, defn :
	ODC_F = (forall v. v not used in F) [ (dZ/dF)' ]


in eg.

ODC_F = (forall c) ( (ab+Fc'+F'b')_(F) ^ (ab+Fc'+F'b')_F' )'
	  = (forall c) ( ab+ac'+a'b'c'+a'bc )
	  = (ab)

NOTE : if (ab) = 1 => Z = 1



in general if F's fanout is begger than 1, meaning Z1(F, ...), ... Zn(F, ...)
then :

ODC_F = (forall v. v var not input of F) (prod xi. xi = (dZi/dF)', i : 1..n)
	where Z1..Zn are the outputs, prod = variadic AND
