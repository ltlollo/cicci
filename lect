Fresavble sched,
Minimize response time for Aperiodic jobs

2 rules
1- Consumption Rule: how much if the budgey is decreased when the server is exe
2- Replenishment Rule: how much the budget is increased

for Defer Server: 1:  1 rate per time unit when the server execs
				  2:  budged is set at e_s at the beginning of a period, and returned to the server at the end of a period
